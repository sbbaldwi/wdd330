            <h1>Question 1: What did I do since the last meeting?</h1>
            <p>I worked on a few of my cards in Trello. I tried to learn a little bit more so I am better prepared to
                contribute to the meetings. I watched a lot of YouTube videos about some of the topics I wasn't as
                familar on. </p>
            <h1>Question 2: What am I going to do next?</h1>
            <p>I am going to continue working on my Trello tasks that I was assigned. In our team meeting we broke it up
                as evenly as possible and I was assigned 3 cards. </p>
            <h1>Question 3: What are my blockers?</h1>
            <p>This last week, I feel like one of my main blockers was just lack of knowledge. I am not super familiar
                with JavaScript right now, because I took a class on JavaScript a while ago. I needed a lot of
                refreshers which I tried to do in my own time, but luckily the people in my group have also been very
                helpful and patient with me. </p>
