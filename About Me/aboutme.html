                <p>Hi! My name is Bri Christiansen and I am a Web Design and Development Major at BYU-Idaho. This is my
                    second to last semester and I am super excited to graduate!!!! In my time as a Web Design and
                    Development Major, I have taken many classes to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, node.js, python, and
                    MySQL.
                    I have also taken design classes using the Adobe products, and a social media marketing class which
                    was
                    one of my favorites. When I graduate I am excited to stay at my current job as a web designer for
                    Handy
                    Optimal, and continue making epic websites for various clients in Idaho, Arizona, and Utah. Aside
                    from
                    web design and development, I am also in the Jazz choir on campus called Vocal Union. At the end of
                    this
                    semester we will be going on tour to Florida and I am super excited about that. I have earned a
                    talent
                    scholarship as part of being in the group, as well as an academic scholarship for my grades. Outside
                    of
                    school, I have been married to my husband for 2 years in April, and we have a super cute Husky named
                    Stormy. </p>

                    <h2>Rexburg Car Shop</h2>
                    <p>Me and the rest of my team at Handy Optimal helped design and implement this website for a car
                        mechanic shop local to Rexburg Idaho. I found a layout using Wordpress with the divi
                        theme. I then replaced, changed, and added my own code to change the layout from what it was to
                        what
                        it looks like now. We kept a few features from the layout but it was really just a starting
                        point to
                        get us to where it is now.</p>

                    <h2>The Diamond P Ranch</h2>
                    <p>I started this project at the beginning of January and we will be going live at the end of the
                        month.
                        This is a website for a horseback riding company located near West Yellowtone. I have really
                        enjoyed
                        making this website and it has been such a neat opportunity for me. It was one of my first solo
                        projects at my job. </p>

                    <h2>Tooth Club For Kids</h2>
                    <p>I did not take part in designing this website, but my company and I have been doing the SEO on
                        this
                        site for over a year now and we have grown their reach by over 500% since we started. We have
                        also
                        run many web campaigns for them on their website. I also got to take a trip to Arizona to film
                        some
                        videos of staff and customers for the website, and they will be going live in a few weeks.
